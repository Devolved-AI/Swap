# Aderyn Analysis Report
## Conducted by Pavon Dunbar on 7-12-2024

This report was generated by [Aderyn](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn), a static analysis tool built by [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io), a blockchain security company. This report is not a substitute for manual audit or security review. It should not be relied upon for any purpose other than to assist in the identification of potential security vulnerabilities.

These are security issues I need to correct in the existing AMM.sol file currently in this repo.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

        ```

## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

        ```solidity
                require(weth.transfer(msg.sender, msg.value), "WETH transfer failed");
        ```

</details>



## L-3: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/AMM.sol [Line: 2](../AMM/src/AMM.sol#L2)

        ```solidity
        pragma solidity ^0.8.22;
        ```

</details>



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

- Found in src/AMM.sol [Line: 212](../AMM/src/AMM.sol#L212)

        ```solidity
            function getBalance(uint256 _pairId, address _account) public view returns (uint256) {
        ```

</details>



## L-5: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

        ```

</details>



## L-6: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
